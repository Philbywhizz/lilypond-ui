[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org) is a fantastic tool for typesetting beautiful musical scores, but its learning curve is _tremendous_. LilyPond-UI makes writing &amp; editing scores in LilyPond easier by providing a set of easy-to-use features in one package:

   * Syntax highlighting
   * In-line error and warning messages
   * Adjustable two-up code and preview windows
   * Easy access to the raw LilyPond output, for debugging

### Getting Started (for macOS, other platforms not (yet) supported).

1. Install the macOS build of LilyPond from [http://lilypond.org/macos-x.html](http://lilypond.org/macos-x.html)
2. Download the most recent `LilyPond.Editor.dmg` from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/doches/lilypond-ui/releases).
3. Open `LilyPond.Editor.dmg` and drag **LilyPond Editor.app** into your `Applications` folder
4. Launch `LilyPond Editor`, open a score, and write!

### Useful Commands

* Quickly save &amp; render the open score with `⌘s`
* To just re-render the file (without saving any changes), hit `⌘r`
* Start fresh with a new LilyPond source file with `⌘n`
* Open a preferences window where you can tweak some settings with `⌘,`

### Testimonials

> I love this app!! I was frustrated trying to learn lilypond with my usual editor (vim) and kept having to switch back and forwards with to preview the pdf (compile, then alt-tab).
> 
> This editor allows me to 'auto-render' and preview my code at every save.
> 
> I hope you continue to develop this editor. It is so much faster and simpler than Frescobaldi (which I find a bit bloaty for my tastes)
